 // 1. Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.
 var a = "Piyush";
 var b = 22;
 var sum = a+b;

 // 2.Use typeof operator to find the datatype of the string in last question.
 console.log(sum,typeof sum);

 // 3.Create a const object in JavaScript. Can you change it to hold a number later?
 const Basket = {
